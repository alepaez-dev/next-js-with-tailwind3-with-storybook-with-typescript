 - NextJs
 - TailwindCss 3
 - Typescript
 - Storybook
 - Husky
 - Eslint with prettier

All with the newest versions.


#### Getting Started
```js
npm install && npm run storybook
# or
yarn && yarn storybook
```

If you use npm make sure to erase yarn.lock as it is not recommended to mix package managers.


If it is the first time you run ```yarn storybook``` and the components won't render as expected(image below) make sure to refresh or hard refresh if needed.
